This library is a .NET implementation of websocket client. It is a C++/CLI wrapper of Microsoft C++ Rest SDK.

# Background
Although Windows 8 and later natively support websocket protocol, older versions of Windows are not able to use the official implementation. Microsoft has a websocket library for older version of Windows, but it's available only for C++. ClientWebSocket for .NET Framework 4.x bridges the gap.
